### Research Question

"How to store and query evolving knowledge graphs on the Web?"
challenges: (let them correspond to the chapters)
    * The Web is highly heterogeneous
    * Experimentation requires realistic evolving data
    * Indexing evolving data is a trade-off between storage size and lookup efficiency
    * Publishing evolving data via a queryable interface is costly
