<!-- Context      -->
The Web has become our most valuable tool for sharing information.
<span class="comment" data-author="mvs">Next sentence comes a bit out of nowhere. Add the machine-readable Web content argument?</span>
Using *knowledge graphs*, this information can be linked in a structured way,
so that intelligent agents can act upon this data autonomously.
Current knowledge graphs remain however rather static.
<span class="comment" data-author="mvs">You could make this stronger and say that static knowledge graphs are not a sustainable representation of facts on the Web.</span>
As there is a lot of value in acting upon *evolving* knowledge,
<!-- Need         -->
there is a need for *evolving knowledge graphs*.
<span class="comment" data-author="mvs">I'd be more specific about "what" exactly is needed with evolving knowledge graphs. Basically what comes next: representing, storing and querying </span>
<!-- Task         -->
As such, the goal of this PhD is to allow such evolving knowledge graphs to be stored and queried,
<span class="comment" data-author="mvs">The connection to a decentralized Web is a bit odd. Isn't this also more part of the need?</span>
taking into account the *decentralized* nature Web
where anyone should be able say anything about anything.
<!-- Object       -->
Concretely, four challenges related to this goal are investigated:
(1) generation of evolving data,
(2) storage of evolving data,
(3) querying over heterogeneous datasets,
and (4) querying evolving data.
<!-- Findings     -->
For each of these challenges, techniques and algorithms have been developed,
<!-- Conclusion   -->
which prove to be valuable for storing and querying evolving knowledge graphs on the Web.
<!-- Perspectives -->
This work therefore brings us closer towards a Web
in which both human and machine can act upon evolving knowledge.
